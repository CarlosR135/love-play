## Game Overview

In Rock, Paper, Scissors, each player simultaneously selects one of three shapes:
- **Rock** (a fist) crushes **Scissors**.
- **Scissors** (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended) cuts **Paper**.
- **Paper** (an open hand) covers **Rock**.

In this game, you will compete against the computer, which makes a random choice each round. The outcome of each round is determined by the standard rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

## Features

- **Single-player mode**: Play against the computer.
- **Random computer moves**: The computer makes random choices for each round.
- **Score tracking**: Keeps track of the number of rounds won, lost, and tied.
- **User-friendly interface**: Easy-to-use interface for a seamless gaming experience.

## How to Play

1. **Choose your move**: Select Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
2. **Computer makes a move**: The computer will randomly select Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
3. **Determine the winner**: The winner of the round is based on the game rules:
   - Rock crushes Scissors.
   - Scissors cuts Paper.
   - Paper covers Rock.
4. **View results**: The game will display the result of each round and update the score accordingly.
5. **Continue playing**: You can play as many rounds as you like.

Enjoy playing Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer, and see if you can outsmart it!

## Code Explanation

Here's a breakdown of the JavaScript code used in this project:

## Essential Constants

```
const rockButton = document.getElementById('rock');
const paperButton = document.getElementById('paper');
const scissorsButton = document.getElementById('scissors');
const computerChoiceElement = document.getElementById('computer-choice');
const resultElement = document.getElementById('result');


1. These constants store references to the Rock, Paper, Scissors buttons and elements where the computer's choice and the result will be displayed.

function getComputerChoice() {
    const choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors'];
    return choices[Math.floor(Math.random() * choices.length)];
}
```

2. This function randomly selects one of the choices ('rock', 'paper', or 'scissors') for the computer.

# Function to Determine the Winner
```javasript
function determineWinner(playerChoice, computerChoice) {
    if (playerChoice === computerChoice) {
        return 'Tied!';
    }
    if (playerChoice === 'rock' && computerChoice === 'scissors') {
        return 'You won!';
    }
    if (playerChoice === 'paper' && computerChoice === 'rock') {
        return 'You won!';
    }
    if (playerChoice === 'scissors' && computerChoice === 'paper') {
        return 'You won!';
    }
    return 'You lost!';
}
```
3. This function compares the player's choice with the computer's choice and returns the result of the game. Note: there is a small issue in the original code where 'scissors' vs 'paper' was incorrectly returning 'You lost!'. This has been corrected to 'You won!'.

# Event Handlers for Buttons


```
rockButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    const computerChoice = getComputerChoice();
    const result = determineWinner('rock', computerChoice);
    computerChoiceElement.textContent = `The computer chose: ${computerChoice}`;
    resultElement.textContent = result;
});

paperButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    const computerChoice = getComputerChoice();
    const result = determineWinner('paper', computerChoice);
    computerChoiceElement.textContent = `The computer chose: ${computerChoice}`;
    resultElement.textContent = result;
});

scissorsButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    const computerChoice = getComputerChoice();
    const result = determineWinner('scissors', computerChoice);
    computerChoiceElement.textContent = `The computer chose: ${computerChoice}`;
    resultElement.textContent = result;
});
```


4. These event handlers are attached to each button. When a button is clicked, the computer's choice is generated, the winner is determined, and the results are displayed.
